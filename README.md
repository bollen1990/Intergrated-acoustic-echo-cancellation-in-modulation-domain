# Intergrated-acoustic-echo-cancellation-in-modulation-domain

In here, you can find the MATLAB implementation of modulation domain acoustic echo cancellation technique proposed is the paper below

Jayakumar, E. P., PV Muhammed Shifas, and P. S. Sathidevi. "Integrated acoustic echo and noise suppression in modulation domain." International Journal of Speech Technology 19.3 (2016): 611-621.


The echo signal was created on run with the helps of additional functions.

The main function is "AES_echonoise_modulation.m", in which the entire task of echo and noise estimation and cancellation has been done. The code has commented internally, reader can go and see the details inside.
